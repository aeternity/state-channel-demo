  # Contributing to state-channel-demo
  
 ## Submitting an issue
 1. Attach logs from browser console (We initiate channels with `debug: true`) - provides context
 2. Check if issue is already posted
 3. Add github labels for improved readability 


  ## Development
  - If you find an issue you would like to work on, please assign yourself as the assignee!
  - Before submitting a Pull Request, make sure all the tests are passing  
  ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind that both server & client tests depend on a running local node 
  -  If you're implementing a new feature, do not forget to 
     - add JSDoc comments for readability 
     - implement its tests as well ðŸš€

ðŸ’¡ Each Pull Request will be deployed in a staging environment (needs to be triggered by a maintainer)
